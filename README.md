# Branding for Easy Digital Downloads

This is a plugin, which simply adds a "Branding" section to the Download Details box in the editor.

The preset brands are filterable using the `daan_featured_downloads_brands`, so you can add your own.

The purpose of this plugin is to offer an interface to easily add branding elements to your Downloads, so you can use
them in your theme and/or plugin. It does not offer any blocks, etc.
